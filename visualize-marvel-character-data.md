# Explore a dataset with Google Fusion Tables

We're going to do some gentle dataviz with a dataset about Marvel comic book characters introduced in the 1990s. (Dataset adapted from [this one](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/women-in-comic-books/).) We'll use Google Fusion Tables, a relatively easy-to-use, free tool that you can use in your Internet browser. You'll need a Google account to use it. If you don't have one, look over a friend's laptop while they work.

## Download our dataset to your computer

The dataset is located at [https://www.dropbox.com/s/d2fpzxsa3zo2mlr/90smarvel.csv?dl=1](https://www.dropbox.com/s/d2fpzxsa3zo2mlr/90smarvel.csv?dl=0)[.](https://www.dropbox.com/s/upy1367opc1rsli/90smarvelcharacters.csv?dl=0) The download should start automatically as soon as you click on the URL. Please try to remember where you saved your spreadsheet!

## Open Google Fusion Tables

Google Fusion Tables is a fairly easy-to-use visualization tool. To get started, open a new window in your Internet browser, but be sure to leave this window open, so that you have two browser windows open side by side. (This is the hardest part of the tutorial!) In your new window, go to [https://support.google.com/fusiontables/answer/2571232.](https://support.google.com/fusiontables/answer/2571232) Click on **Create a Fusion Table**.

## Upload the data you downloaded in the first step.

With the **From This Computer** tab selected, click on **Choose File**. Then select the file you downloaded in the first step and then **Open**. Then click **Next**. Click on **Next** again, and then **Finish**. (We won't worry about the basic settings for the time being.)

## What's this?

The first tab open in the Google Fusion Tables interface should look familiar -- it's just the same spreadsheet you just downloaded. If you click on the **Cards** tab, you can see the same data, just arranged a little differently. You can even click on the URLs to learn more about each character.

## Let's visualize!

With Google Fusion Tables, you create a new visualization by opening a new tab -- just click on the plus sign right next to the **Cards 1 **tab. Then select **Add chart.**

## This doesn't make much sense!

Fusion Tables has automatically decided to visualize some data that isn't immediately meaningful. Let's select some better categories to visualize. Click on the **Column Chart** button.

## Enter some meaningful categories

Under the **Configure Categorical Chart** heading, choose the following options:

* Category: **Eye**
* Summarize data: **check the box**
* Values: Eye: Count: **check the box**

Why do we click "summarize"? If we don't, Fusion Tables will try to count every incidence of an eye color separately. If we click summarize, Fusion Tables will lump identical eye colors together and add them all up.

## Experiment on your own!

Experiment with other options and categories to see what you can discover about our data on your own. What have you learned about Marvel characters in the 1990s? 

What do you wish you could do that you can't do with this tool? What would you like to figure out? Jot down some ideas so you can share them with the class.
